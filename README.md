## ðŸ“Œ Project Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world fake news data from Kaggle
- Applied text normalization techniques: tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
- Created Bag-of-Words features using **CountVectorizer** with uni-, bi-, and tri-grams
- Built models using:
  - ðŸ”¹ **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
  - ðŸ”¹ **Logistic Regression**
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize accuracy
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall
  - Confusion Matrix with visualization
- Designed a function to classify new/unseen news as **Fake** or **Real**
